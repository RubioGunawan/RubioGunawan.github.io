I am Rubio Gunawan, currently a second year PhD Student studying in the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Trieste.
My PhD fellowship is supported by a joint program with the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste.
I am expected to finish my degree in fall 2027.

My research interest is on dynamical systems, with a focus on one-dimensional dynamics and ergodic theory.
